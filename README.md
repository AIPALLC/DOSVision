DOSVision is a Distributed Denial of Service Detector &amp; Blocker created for hosted VPS Sites/Games/other. DOSVision is open-source, the source is currently licensed though but is completely **FREE** to use, modify. If you'd like to republish this, please credit me as this took a lot of time to make. DOSVision is known for it's Power, Protection and how it works. The Anti-DDOS can block up to **2-8 thousand** packets per second or more. The amount it blocks has an accelaration, for example you've reached 2,000 packets blocked; Now, it doubles the amount and goes up to **4,000 packets blocked per second** or over. In an hour, you can reach up to **a million packets blocked per second.**

DOSVision is going to be updated, but not often at all. I'm currently busy with some other stuff, so I'm just doing this for fun. Whoever wants to use this for their VPS, then feel free to do so.
